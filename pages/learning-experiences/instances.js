					This activity takes your child through the exciting
					adventure of discovering that a microbe can cause a disease,
					with the help of a video game format augmented by hands-on
					tasks involving microscopes.
					<br />
					<br />
					Apart from the information gain, your child will learn the
					scientific method: investigating, developing a hypothesis,
					then testing the hypothesis. This enhances their critical
					thinking, ability to identify conditional relationships, and
					reasoning skills. encourages them to identify as smart
					individuals who can practice STEM if they so choose. These
					processes also encourage your child&apos;s use of language,
					literacy, and mathematics skills in authentic ways.
					<br />
					<br />
					The Nudge way of learning also emphasises collaborative
					learning. This activity especially, also places emphasis on
					science as a collaborative subject, thus busting the myth
					that research is a lonely pursuit. Your child will learn to
					work in a team, to share ideas, to voice their own opinion
					and build off the ideas of others, and hence to work well
					with everyone in their team to win the special prize.
					<br />
					<br />
					Micrographs (pictures of specimens as observed from the
					microscope, like the one above) can also be extremely
					beautiful - possibly a new hobby for a budding
					microbiologist!
